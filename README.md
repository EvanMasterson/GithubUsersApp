# Github Search
Search GitHub users by username, retrieves results from [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#search-users), results diplayed in a TableViewController where reordering and deletion of cells is in place. Clicking a cell navigates to the DetailViewController where more information is retrieved for the user like follower, following, repository and gist counts.

Implements asynchronous network requests, using Lottie for displaying loading animations as feedback for the user.

Images are cached and loaded asynchronously with SDWebImage

Third Party libraries integerated with [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/)
